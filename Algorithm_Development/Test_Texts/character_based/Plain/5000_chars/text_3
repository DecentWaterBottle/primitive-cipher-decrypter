Always talking about the war cried the count across the table You see I have a son who is going Marya Dmitri evna my son is going Well I have four sons in the army but I dont mourn over it Gods will rules all You may die at home lying on your oven or God may bring you safe out of battle rang Marya Dmitrievnas loud voice without any effort from the farther end of the table That is so And the conversation again was confined among the ladies at their end of the table and among the men at theirs You wont dare to ask it said Natashas little brother to her I tell you you wont dare to Yes I will too replied Natasha Her face suddenly kindled and expressed a desperate and mischievous resolution She started up with a glance caus ing Pierre who was sitting opposite to her to listen and ad dressed her mother Mamma rang her childish chest voice across the table What is it you wish asked the countess alarmed but seeing by her daughters face that it was some prank she shook her finger sternly at her and shook her head warningly There was a lull in the conversation Mamma what sort of pastry is coming cried the little voice even more clearly and without any hesitation The countess tried to look severe but could not Marya Dmitrievna shook her stout finger at the girl Cossack said she The majority of the guests looked at the old ladies and did not know what to make of this freak You will see what I shall do to you said the countess Mamma tell me what pastry are we going to have cried Natasha again all in a giggle and assured in her own merry little heart that her prank would not be taken amiss Sonya and the stout little Petya were struggling with sup pressed laughter 66 There I did ask whispered Natasha to her little brother and to Pierre on whom she again fastened her eyes Ices but you are not to have any said Marya Dmi trievna Natasha saw that there was nothing to be afraid of and therefore she had no fear of Marya Dmitrievna Marya Dmitrievna what kind of ices I dont like ice cream Carrot 76 WAR AND PEACE No what kind Marya Dmitrievna tell me what kind she almost screamed Marya Dmitrievna and the countess laughed and the rest of the guests did the same All laughed not so much at Marya Dmitrievnas repartee as at the incomprehensible bravery and cleverness of the little girl who could and dared treat Marya Dmitrievna so Natasha was made to hold her tongue only when she was told that they were to have pineapple sherbet Before the ices were brought champagne was handed around Again the orchestra played the count exchanged kisses with his little countess and the guests standing drank a health to the hostess clinking their glasses across the table with the count with the children and with each other Again the waiters bustled about there was the noise of moving chairs and in the same order but with more flushed faces the guests returned to the drawingroom and to the counts cabinet CHAPTER XVIII THE card tables were brought out partners were selected and the counts guests scattered through the two drawing rooms the divanroom and the library The count having arranged his cards in a fan shape found it difficult to keep from indulging in his usual afterdinner nap and laughed heartily at everything The young people at the countesss instigation gathered around the clavichord and the harp Julie first by general request played a piece with variations on the harp and then she joined with the rest of the girls in urging Natasha and Nikolai whose musical talent was known to all to sing something Natasha was evidently very much flattered by this request and at the same time it filled her with trepidation What shall we sing she asked The Fountain suggested Nikolai Well give me the music quick Boris come here said Natasha But where is Sonya She looked around and seeing that her cousin was nowhere in the room she started to find her She ran into Sonyas room and not finding her there has tened to the nursery but she was not there Natasha then came to the conclusion that Soyna might be in the corridor on the great chest The great chest in the corridor was the place of mourning for all the young women of the house of Rostof There in fact Sonya was found in her airy pink frock all crumpled lying flat on her face on a dirty striped pillow that belonged to the nurse and hiding her face in her hands was crying as though her heart would break while her poor bare shoulders shook under her sobs Natashas face which had been so radiant all through her name day suddenly changed her eyes grew fixed then her throat contracted and the corners of her mouth drew down Sonya what is the matter Tell me what is it what is the matter with you Oooooo And Natasha opening her large mouth and becoming perfectly ugly cried like a child without knowing any reason for it except that Sonya was crying Sonya tried to lift up her head tried to answer but found it impossible and hid her face again Natasha sat down on the blue cushion and threw her arms around her dear At length Sonya put forth an effort sat up and began to wipe away her tears saying 66 Nikolenka is going away in a week hispapers have come he himself told me so But I should not have wept She held out a piece of paper which she had been reading it contained the verses which Nikolai had written for her I should not have wept for that but you cannot understand No one can understand what a noble heart he has And once more her tears began to flow at the thought of what a noble heart he had You are happy I do not envy you I love you and Boris too said she composing herself by an effort He is good for you there are no obstacles But Nikolai is my cousin we should have to the archbishop himself else it would be impossible And then if mamenka Sonya always regarded the countess as her mother and called her so she will say that I am spoiling Nikolais career that I am heart Nikolai wrote these verses himself and I copied off some other ones and she found them on my table and said that she was going to show them to mamenka and she said too that I was ungrateful that mamenka would never let him marry me and that he was going to marry Julie You saw how he was with her all
