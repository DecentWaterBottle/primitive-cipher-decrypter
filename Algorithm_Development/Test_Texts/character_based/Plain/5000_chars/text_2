He had hardly finished singing the last word when prepara tions began to be made for dancing and the musicians made their way into the gallery with a trampling of feet and coughing Pierre was sitting in the drawing room with Shinshin who knowing that he had recently returned from abroad was try ing to induce a political conversation that was exceedingly tedious to the young man several others had joined the group When the music struck up Natasha went into the drawingroom and going straight up to Pierre said laughing and blushing Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers I am afraid of spoiling the figures said Pierre but if you will act as my teacher and he offered his big arm to the dainty damsel though he was obliged to put it down very low While the couples were getting their places and the musi cians were tuning up Pierre sat down with his little lady Natasha was perfectly delighted she was going to dance with a big man who had just come from abroad She sat out in front of everybody and talked with him exactly as though she were grown up In her hand she had a fan which some lady had given her to hold and with all the selfpossession of an accomplished lady of the world God knows when and where she had learned it she talked with her cavalier flirt ing her fan and smiling behind it Well well do look at her do look at her said the countess as she passed through the ballroom and caught sight of Natasha The girl reddened and laughed Now what is it mamma what would you like What is there extraordinary about me In the midst of the third Ecossaise the chairs in the drawingroom where the count and Marya Dmitrievna were playing cards were moved back and a large number of the distinguished guests and the older people stretching their cramped limbs after long sitting and putting their port monaies and wallets into their pockets came into the ball room First of all came the count and Marya Dmitrievna both with radiant faces The count with farcical politeness as though in ballet fashion offered the lady his bended arm Then he straightened himself and his face lighted with a peculiarly shrewd and youthful smile and as soon as the last figure of the cossaise was danced through he clapped his hands at the musicians and called out to the first violin Semyon Do you know Daniel Cooper This was the counts favorite dance which he had danced when he was a young man more particularly it was one of the figures of the Anglaise Look at papa cried Natasha loud enough to be heard all over the ballroom She forgot entirely that she was dancing with a grownup man She bent her curly head over her knees and let her merry laugh ring out unchecked Indeed all who were in the hall gazed with a smile of pleas ure at the jolly little man standing with the dignified Marya Dmitrievna who was considerably taller than her partner holding his arms in a bow straightening his shoulders and turning out his toes slightly beating time with his foot while a beaming smile spread more and more over his round face and gave the spectators an inkling of what was to follow As soon as the merry fascinating sounds of Daniel Cooper were heard reminding one of the national dance the trepak all the doors to the ballroom were suddenly filled on one side by the serving men belonging to the household on the other with the women all with smiling faces coming to look at their merryhearted barin Oh our little father an eagle exclaimed an old nurse in a loud staccato in one of the doors The count danced well and he knew it but his partner had absolutely no wish or ability to dance well Her portentous form was erect and her big hands hung down by her side she had handed her reticule to the countess only her stern but handsome face danced Whatwas expressed in the whole rotund person of the count was expressed in Marya Dmitrievna merely in her ever more and more radiantly smiling face and loftier lifted nose But while the count growing ever more and more lively captivated the spectators by the unexpectedness of his grace ful capers and the light gambols of his lissome legs Marya Dmitrievna by the slightest animation on her part by the motion of her shoulders or the bending of her arms in turning about or beating time produced the greatest impression for the very reason that every one always felt a certain awe before her dignity of bearing and habitual severity The dance grew livelier and livelier The other dancers could not for an instant attract attention to themselves and did not even try All eyes were fastened on the count and Marya Dmitrievna Natasha kept pulling at the sleeves and dresses of all who were near her to make them look at her papenka but even without this reminder they would have found it hard to take their eyes off the two dancers The count in the intervals of the dance made desperate efforts to get breath waved his hands and cried to the musi cians to play faster Quicker quicker and ever quicker lighter lighter and ever more lightly gambolled the count now on his toes now on his heels pirouetting around Marya Dmitrievna and at last having conducted the lady to her place he made one last pas lifting his fat leg up from behind in a magnifi cent scrape and bowing his perspiring head low at the same time with a smiling face sweeping his arm round amid rap turous applause and laughter especially on the part of Natasha Both of the dancers paused breathing heavily and wiping their heated faces with cambric handkerchiefs Thats the way we used to dance in our time ma chre said the count Good for Daniel Cooper exclaimed Marya Dmitrievna drawing a long breath and tucking back her sleeves dancing the sixth Anglaise and the musicians from weariness were beginning to play out of tune and the tired servants and cooks were preparing for the supper Count Bezukhoi received his sixth stroke of apoplexy The doctors declared that there was not the slightest hope of his rallying from it The form of confession and communion was administered to the dying man and preparations were making for extreme unction while the mansion was filled with the bustle and expectati
