Outside the house around the doors hidden by the throngs of carriages gathered the undertakers hoping to reap a rich harvest from the counts obsequies The military governor of Moscow who had been assiduous in sending his adjutant to inquire for the count this evening came himself to bid farewell to the famous grandee of Cather ines time The magnificent receptionroom was crowded All stood deferentially when the governor who had been closeted for half an hour with the sick man came out slightly bowing in reply to the salutations and endeavoring to pass as rapidly as possible by the doctors priests and relatives who fixed their eyes upon him Prince Vasili grown a trifle thinner and paler under the strain accompanied the military governor and was repeating something in an undertone Having seen the distinguished caller to the door Prince Va sili sat down alone in the hall threw one leg over the other resting his elbow on his knee and covering his eyes with his hand Having sat that way for some little time he got up and with hasty irregular steps looking around with startled eyes he passed through the long corridor that led to the rear portion of the house to the room occupied by the oldest of the three princesses The visitors in the dimly lighted receptionroom talked among themselves in low whispers and relapsed into silence looking with eyes full of curiosity or expectation when the door that led into the death chamber opened to let any one pass in or out The limit of his life said a little old man a priest to a lady sitting near him and listening earnestly the limit is fixed he will not live beyond it It seems to me it is late for extreme unction is it not asked the lady adding the name of the priest She affected to be unenlightened upon this point It is a great mystery gentle lady replied the priest pass ing his hand over his bald forehead on which still lay a few carefully brushed locks of grayish hair 66 Who was that The Governor of Moscow some one asked at the other end of the room What a young looking man But hes seventy years old They say dont they that the count doesnt recognize any one any longer Are they going to give him extreme unction All I know is hes had seven strokes The second niece just came out of the sick chamber with weeping eyes and sat down by Doctor Lorrain who had as sumed a graceful position under the portrait of the Empress Catherine and sat with his elbow resting on the table Beautiful weather princess and this being in Moscow is like being in the country said the doctor in French It is indeed said the princess with a sigh Can he have a drink Lorrain pondered a moment Has he taken his medicine Yes Take a glass of boiled water and add a pinch he indicated with his slender fingers what he meant by a pinch of cream of tartar Ineffer heard of a gase vere a mahn surfifed more dan a dird stroke said a German doctor to an adjutant What a constitution the man must have had said the adjutant And who will get all his wealth he added in a whisper Some vun vill be fount to tek it replied the German with a smile Again they all looked at the door it opened to let the young princess pass with the drink which Lorrain had sug gested for the sick man The German doctor went over to Lorrain Do you think he will last till to morrow morn ing he asked in atrocious French Lorrain thrust out his lips and made a motion of severe negation with his fingers in front of his nose Tonight at latest said he in a low voice with a slight smile of self satisfaction at being able to understand and ex press the state of his patient then he went out Meantime Prince Vasili had opened the door into the prin cesss apartment It was almost dark in the room two little lamps were burning before the holy pictures and there was a pleasant odor of incense and flowers The whole room was furnished with small articles of furniture chiffonieres cabinets and lit tle tables Behind a screen could be seen the white curtain of a high post bedstead A little dog came running out and barking Ah is it you mon cousin She got up and smoothed her hair which as always was so extraordinarily smooth that one would have thought it made of one piece with her head and then covered with varnish What is it What has happened she asked You startled me so Nothing There is no change I only came to have a talk with you Katish about business said the prince wearily sitting down in the chair from which she had just risen How warm you are here he exclaimed However sit down there let us talk I thought something must have happened said the prin cess and she took a seat in front of him with her face hard and stony as usual and prepared to hear what he had to say I was trying to get a nap mon cousin and I could not Well my dear said Prince Vasili taking the princesss hand and doubling it over in a way peculiar to himself It was evident that this well my dear referred to a number of things which though unspoken were understood by both of them The princess with her long thin waist so disproportionate to the rest of her body looked at the prince full in the face from her prominent gray eyes Then she shook her

Vasili explained this action as an expression of weariness Thats the way with me said he Do you suppose its any easier for me I am as played out as a post horse but still I must have a talk with you Katish and a very serious one Prince Vasili became silent and his cheeks began to twitch nervously first on one side then on the other giving his face an unpleasant look such as it never had when he was in com pany His eyes also were different from usual at one moment they gleamed impudently malicious at the next a sort of fear lurked in them The princess holding the little dog in her dry thin hands in her lap scrutinized the prince sharply but it was plain to see that she did not intend to break the silence by asking any question even though she sat till morning Do you not see my dear
