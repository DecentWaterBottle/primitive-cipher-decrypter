him in Moscow drawingrooms He talked as though it were an act of condescension toward his opponent The other a fresh ruddy young officer of the Guard irre proachably belted buttoned and barbered held the mouth piece in the middle of his mouth and gently sucked the smoke through his rosy lips sending it out in rings from his hand some mouth This was Lieutenant Berg an officer of the Semyenovsky regiment with whom Boris was going to the army the very person about whom Natasha had teased Viera by calling him her lover The count was sitting between these two and listening attentively The occupation that the count enjoyed most next to the game of Boston of which he was very fond was that of listener especially when he had a chance to get two good talkers on the opposite sides of an argument Well now batyushka my most honorable Alphonse Kar litch said Shinshin with a sneer and as his custom was when he talked mixing up the most colloquial Russian expressions with the most refined French idioms your idea is to make money out of the state you expect to get a nice little income from your company do you Not at all Piotr Nikolaitch I only wish to prove that the advantages of serving in the cavalry are far less than in the infantry You can now imagine my position Piotr Niko laitch Berg always spoke very accurately calmly and politely His conversation invariably had himself as its central point he always preserved a discreet silence when people were talk ing about anything that did not directly concern himself and he could sit that way silently for hours without feeling or causing others to feel the slightest sense of awkwardnes But as soon as the conversation touched any subject in which he was personally interested he would begin to talk at length and with evident satisfaction Consider my position Piotr Nikolaitch if I were in the cavalry I should not receive more than two hundred a quarter even with the rank of lieutenant but now I get two hundred and thirty said he with a pleasant joyful smile glancing at Shinshin and the count as though it were plain for him that his success would always be an object of interest to everybody else Moreover Piotr Nikolaitch continued Berg by being transferred to the Guard I am in sight vacancies in the in fantry occur far more often Then you can see for yourself on two hundred and thirty rubles a quarter how well I can live I can lay up some and send some to my father too he went on to say puffing out a spiral of smoke Thats where the difference lies a German can grind corn on the but of his hatchet as the proverb puts it said Shinshin shifting the mouthpiece of his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count The count laughed heartily The other guests seeing that Shinshin was engaged in a lively conversation crowded round to listen Berg remarking neither the quizzical nor indiffer ent looks of the others proceeded to explain how by his trans fer to the Guard he would attain rank before his comrades of the Corpus how in time of war the company commanders were apt to be killed and he if left the senior in the com pany might very easily become a captain and how everybody in the regiment liked him and how proud of him his papenka was Berg evidently took great delight in telling all this and he never seemed to suspect that other people had also their inter ests But all that he said was so suavely serious the naivete of his youthful egotism was so palpable that he quite disarmed his auditors Well my lad whether you are in the infantry or in the guard you will get on that I can predict said Shinshin tapping him on the shoulder and setting his feet down from the ottoman Berg smiled with self satisfaction The count followed by his guests passed into the drawing room It was the time just before dinner is announced when the assembled guests in expectation of being summoned to par take of the zakuska are disinclined to entering any detailed conversation and at the same time feel that it is incumbent upon them to stir about and say something in order to show that they are in no haste to sit down The host and hostess keep watching the dining door and exchange glances from time to time The guests try to read in those glances for whom or for what they are waiting some belated influential connection or for some dish that is not done in time Pierre came in just before the dinner hour and awkwardly sat down in the first chair that he saw right in the middle of the drawingroom so that he was in everybodys way The answered her questions in monosyllables and kept looking naively around him through his spectacles as though in search of some one It was exceedingly annoying but he was the only person who did not notice it The majority of the guests knowing about his adventure with the bear looked curiously at this big tall quietlooking man and found it difficult to believe that such a burly unassuming creature could have played such a trick on a police officer Have you only just come asked the countess Oui madame replied he glancing around You have not seen my husband Non madame And he smiled at absolutely the wrong time You were in Paris lately I believe I think it is very interesting Very interesting The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhailovna who perceived that she was wanted to take charge of this young man She took a seat by his side and began to talk to him about his father but he answered her just as he had the countess merely in monosyllables The other guests were all engaged in little groups Les Razoumovsky That was charming You are very good La Comtesse Aprak sine were the broken phrases that were heard on all sides The countess got up and went into the hall Is that you Marya Dmitrievna rang her voice through the hall My own self was the answer in a harsh voice and imme diately after Marya Dmitrievna entered the room All the young ladies and even the married women except those who were aged rose Marya Dmitrievna paused in the doorway She was tall and erect fifty years old and wore her gray hair in ringlets Under the pretext of turning back and adjusting the wide sleeves of h
