will go pretty hard with the English if only Napoleon crosses the Channel wont it I think the expedition is feasible if only Villeneuve doesnt fail him Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition he had not read the newspapers and this was the first time he had ever heard of Villeneuve We here in Moscow are more taken up with dinners and gossip than with politics said he in his calm satirical tone I know nothing about such things Moscow is given over especially to tittletattle he went on to say Now you and the count are the talk Pierre smiled his goodnatured smile as though to depre cate anything unpleasant which his companion might be likely to say But Boris spoke with due circumspection clearly and dryly looking straight into Pierres eyes WAR AND PEACE 63 Moscow likes to do nothing better than talk gossip he repeated All are solicitous about knowing to whom the count is going to leave his property and yet very possibly he will outlive all of us I hope so with all my heart Yes this is all very trying interrupted Pierre very trying Pierre all the time was apprehensive lest this young officer should unexpectedly turn the conversation into some awkward channel But it must seem to you said Boris flushing slightly but not allowing his voice or his manner to vary it must seem to you that all take an interest in this simply because they hope to get something from the estate Here it comes thought Pierre I expressly wish to tell you lest any misunderstanding should arise that you are entirely mistaken if you consider me and my mother in the number of these people We are very poor but I at least say this on my own account for the very reason that your father is rich that I do not consider myself a relative of his and neither I nor my mother would ask or even be willing to receive anything from him Pierre for some time failed to comprehend but when the idea dawned upon him he leaped from the sofa seized Boris under the arm with characteristic impetuosity and clumsiness and while he reddened even more than the other he began to speak with a mixed feeling of vexation and shame Now this is strange I then indeed and who would have ever thought I know very well But Boris again interrupted him I am glad that I have told you all Perhaps it was dis agreeable to you you will pardon me said he soothing Pierre instead of letting himself be soothed by him I hope that I have not offended you It is a principle with me to speak righ
