as she came running up to kiss her hand gayly and without any fear I know that this little girl is a madcap but I am fond of her all the same She took out of a monstrous reticule a pair of pear shaped amethyst earrings and gave them to the blushing Natasha in honor of her name day then she turned immediately upon Pierre H h my dear come here right here she cried in a pretendedly gentle voice Come here my dear fellow And she threateningly pulled her sleeve still higher Pierre went to her ingenuously looking at her through his spectacles Come here come my dear fellow I have been the only one who dared tell your father the whole truth when he required it and now I shall do the same in your case Its Gods will She paused All held their breath waiting for what was to come and feeling that this was but the prologue Hes a fine lad I must say a fine lad His father lying on his deathbed and this young man amuses himself by tying a policeman on a bears back For shame batyushka for shame You would better have gone to the war She turned away from him and gave her hand to the count who found it difficult to keep from laughing outright Well then to dinner it is ready I believe said Marya Dmitrievna The count led the way with Marya Dmitrievna followed by the countess escorted by the colonel of hussars a man to be made much of since Nikolai was to join his regiment Anna Mikhailovna went with Shinshin Berg gave his arm to Viera The smiling Julie Karagina went with Nikolai to the table Behind them followed the rest in couples making a long line through the hall and the rear was brought up by the tutors and governesses each leading one of the children The waiters bustled about chairs were noisily pushed back an orchestra was playing in the gallery and the guests took their places The sounds of the counts private band were soon drowned in the clatter of knives and forks the voices of the guests and the hurrying steps of the waiters At the head of the table sat the countess Marya Dmitrievna at her right Anna Mikhailovna at her left then the other ladies At the other end of the table sat the count with the colonel of hussars at his left and Shinshin and the other men at his right At one side of the long table were the young gentlemen and ladies Viera next to Berg Pierre and Boris together all fa cing the children and their guardians on the other side The count through the long line of decanters and vases with fruits looked across to his wife and her towering head dress with its blue ribbons and zealously helped his neighbors to wine not forgetting himself The countess also not neglect ing the duties of a hostess cast significant glances at her hus band over the tops of the pineapples and it seemed to her that his bald forehead and face were all the more conspicu ously rubicund from the contrast of his gray hair On the ladies side there was an unceasing buzz of conversa tion On the side of the men the voices grew louder and louder and loudest of all talked the colonel of hussars who ate and drank all that he could his face growing more and more flushed so that the count felt called upon to hold him up to the other guests as an example Berg with an affec tionate smile was talking with Viera on the theme of love being not an earthly but a heavenly feeling Boris was enlightening his new friend Pierre as to the guests who were at the table and occasionally exchanged glances with Natasha whose seat was on the opposite side Pierre himself said little but he ate much while he scanned the faces of the guests Having been offered two kinds of soups he had chosen turtle and from the fishkulebyaka to the saut of woodcock he did not refuse a single dish or any of the wines which the butler offered him thrusting the bottle mysteriously wrapped in a white napkin over his neighbors shoulder murmuring dry Madeira or Hungarian or Rhine wine He held up the first that he happened to lay his hand upon of the four wineglasses engraved with the counts arms that stood before each guest and drank rap turously and the face that he turned upon the guests grew constantly more and more friendly Natasha sitting opposite gazed at Boris as young girls of thirteen only can on the lad with whom they have just ex changed kisses and are very much in love Occasionally she let her eyes rest on Pierre and this glance of the ridiculous little maiden so lively in all her ways almost made him feel like laughing he could not tell why Nikolai was seated at some distance from Sonya and next to Julie Karagina and was again talking with her with the same involuntary smile Sonya also had a smile on her lips but it was not natural and she was evidently tortured by jeal ousy first she turned pale then red and was trying with all her might to imagine what Nikolai and Julie were talking about The governess was looking around nervously as though ready to make resistance should any one presume to injure her young charges The German tutor was endeavoring to fix in his memory all the different courses desserts and wines so as to give a full description of it when he wrote home to Germany he felt sorely grieved because the butler who had the bottle wrapped in the napkin passed him by He frowned and tried to make it appear that he had no wish to taste that wine and was only affronted because no one was willing to see that he needed the wine not for allaying his thirst or from greediness but from motives of mere curiosity Ar the mens end of the table the conversation was growing more and more animated The colonel was telling that the manifesto in regard to the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that he had seen a copy of it which had been brought that day by a courier to the com manderinchief Why the deuce should it behoove us to fight with Bona parte exclaimed Shinshin he has already made Austria talk very mild I fear that now it will be our turn The colonel was a stout tall German of a sanguine temper
